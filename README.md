### Machine Learning for Data Science I

This course covers various machine learning algorithms in detail. This repository contains the practical implementations of some of them.

- Decision trees and random forests
- Model evaluation
- Generalized linear models (Multinomial and Ordinal Logistic Regression)
- Neural networks
- Kernels (kernelized linear regression and SVM)
- Bayesian inference (MCMC, Poisson GLM, Laplace approximation)

  Each folder contains a pdf with instructions, source code and a report.
